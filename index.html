          <span class="small-body-text">The usability testing can be described as the most fundamental usability
            method.
            There are four main types of usability testing: <br /><br />

            - Exploratory, to test preliminary concepts and evaluate their promise.<br /><br />

            - Assessment, to test features during implementation.<br /><br />

            - Comparison, to assess on design against another.<br /><br />

            - Validation, to certify that features meet certain standards and benchmarks late in the development
            process.<br /><br />

            Every usability test has the primary goal of improving the usability
            of the end product and satisfying the needs of a particular group of
            users or the implementation of the product in a particular environment</span>

                they touched the laptop until the desired outcome was achieved or the participant
                abandoned the task. Each task had a different desired outcome. Task one was when the
                user opened a lecture slide, task two was when the user read the overall grade aloud
                and task three was when the user read the exam time information aloud.

                  <b>Task One</b><br />
                  Task one was to open a lecture slide within the COMP719 – Applied Human Computer Interaction
                  paper. All users were successfully able to complete this task as most of them had experience
                  with the blackboard system, however some confusion was present due to the pages being named
                  “course notes”, “lecture notes” & “resources” in other papers within blackboard system. <br /><br />

                  From table 1, the following statistics can be mentioned:<br /><br />
                  - Total of Time Completion: <b>260.51 seconds</b><br />
                  - Average Completion Time: <b>21.61 seconds</b>

                  <b>Task Two</b><br />
                  Task two was to identify the total grade for ENSE701 Contemporary Methods in Software Engineering
                  Assignment One. If the grade was wrong we told the participant it was wrong and asked them to
                  continue
                  looking. All users were successfully able to complete this task, however several users were uncertain
                  whether they had found the correct grade, as the overall grade was not clearly labelled and there
                  were
                  multiple navigation pathways to the grade which added to the confusion.<br /><br />

                  From table 2, the following statistics can be mentioned:<br /><br />
                  - Total of Time Completion: <b>422.28 seconds</b><br />

                  <b>Task Three</b><br />
                  Task three was to identify the date and time that the exam for COMP700 Text and Vision Intelligence
                  will take place. Most users noted that the placement of the timetable was unusual and not intuitive,
                  and that without previous experience this would be a difficult task to complete. This was proved when
                  participant 5 did not have any previous experience with the exam timetable and was unable to complete
                  the task. Since participant 5 could not complete the task they were allotted the max time as a
                  default.
                  His result was omitted from the average completion time for consistency but was left in the total
                  time.<br /><br />

                  From table 3, the following statistics can be mentioned:<br /><br />

                  <b>Year:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Three<br /><br />

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">The study I participated in for Applied Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) was a Usability Study
                  of the Blackboard learning management system used at Auckland University of Technology (AUT).
                  I was involved in the research and development section of the study as well as the analysis and
                  organisation of our findings. Once the initial research, experiment, and analysis had been
                  completed I began constructing a webpage to display our findings in an easy to read format.
                  I designed and built the template and assisted in inserting and formatting our results.<br /><br />

                  This study gave me valuable experience of usability testing and the importance of human-centered
                  design. Understanding the issues and difficulties our participants experienced and collecting
                  meaningful data from our experiment gave me insight into where the Blackboard system/website can
                  be improved. I found it interesting that prior experience with Blackboard had a significant impact
                  on usability and navigation with most of our participants mentioning at some point the initial
                  difficulty they faced when using the system for the first time. <br /><br />

                  Specifically, I learned a lot in regard to the Usability Testing Framework and qualitative
                  testing methods such as learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction, and
                  how users interact with a product via these methods. <br /><br />

                  Overall this project was highly beneficial to me as an aspiring User Experience/User Interface
                  designer and will be leaning heavily into all the lessons I learned as I move forward and on to
                  new projects. The big takeaway for me was how important Human Centered Design is in the software
                  or product development cycle - if we can get this part right from the start, the rest of the
                  development will make sense and have a higher chance of success when released to the end users.<br /></p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify">My name is Saksham Anand, and I am in final semester of Bachelor of
                    Computer & Information
                    Sciences,
                    majoring in Computational Intelligence. Our study was essentially based around the usability of
                    AUT’s
                    blackboard system, with different user demographics. The participants were bought into the lab and
                    given
                    a set of instructions to complete a task, this was combined with pre and post task questionnaire
                    and
                    allowed
                    us to judge the users thought of chain. My role in this project was to work with the team in
                    preparing the
                    pre and post task questionnaires that the user will be using, and writing the research section of
                    the
                    report.</p>

                  <br />
                  <p style="text-align: justify">I discovered some interesting points about the human psychology during
                    the user interviews of
                    the blackboard.
                    In specific, I found that people often like to categorize things in different ways, for example
                    during our
                    experiment some people expected grades to be under the ‘paper page’ on blackboard, however after
                    not
                    finding
                    the grades under paper page, the user then decided to go look for a page which contains all the
                    grades. This
                    was interesting for me because the grades page is technically categorized as well, so I expected
                    users to
                    straight look there. One question this has me wondering is why do categorisations differ between
                    users, for
                    example some people sort out blocks by their shapes, however others may sort out blocks by their
                    colour.</p>

                  <br />I also found the following points interesting about this study:<br /><br />
                  <ul>

                    <li style="text-align: justify">This study gave me insights into User-Centered Design (UCD), as
                      part of the research I discovered the
                      UCD
                      methodology where users are interviewed during the development stages of a software or a website,
                      and
                      based
                      off the interviews the pain points are fixed during development stage. If this methodology is
                      applied
                      to
                      blackboard upgrade development, it would allow the system to be user friendly where it is built
                      on
                      user feedback.</li><br />

                    <li style="text-align: justify">I learnt how people from different backgrounds and diversity have
                      different experience with
                      blackboard, for
                      example some of the mature/older students took a bit longer to navigate blackboard, compared to
                      those
                      who might
                      have used similar knowledge management system in high school (such as Knowledgenet).</li><br />

                    <li style="text-align: justify">Most importantly, I discovered that building softwares and
                      applications is not only about code and
                      project
                      management, its more about the users who will be using the product. There is no point in me
                      spending
                      months
                      coding a software, if the end users don’t understand and like the final outcome.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br /><br />
                  <p style="text-align: justify">To sum it up, I believe the project accomplished its goal of obtaining
                    insights into area
                    of problems within
                    AUT’s blackboard website. We discovered several points of interest where blackboard could be
                    improved, such as
                    having lecture powerpoints open within browser instead of forcing users to download them. With
                    proper
                    planning
                    for pre and post activity questionnaire we were able to capture and analyze user data from the
                    tasks,
                    which
                    allowed us to check if any correlation existed between users finding website easy to navigate and
                    how
                    fast
                    they completed the task.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">The study I participated in for Applied Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) was a Usability Study
                      of the Blackboard learning management system used at Auckland University of Technology (AUT).
                      I was involved in the research and development section of the study as well as the analysis and
                      organisation of our findings. Once the initial research, experiment, and analysis had been
                      completed I began constructing a webpage to display our findings in an easy to read format.
                      I designed and built the template and assisted in inserting and formatting our results.<br /><br />
    
                      This study gave me valuable experience of usability testing and the importance of human-centered
                      design. Understanding the issues and difficulties our participants experienced and collecting
                      meaningful data from our experiment gave me insight into where the Blackboard system/website can
                      be improved. I found it interesting that prior experience with Blackboard had a significant impact
                      on usability and navigation with most of our participants mentioning at some point the initial
                      difficulty they faced when using the system for the first time. <br /><br />
    
                      Specifically, I learned a lot in regard to the Usability Testing Framework and qualitative
                      testing methods such as learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction, and
                      how users interact with a product via these methods. <br /><br />
    
                      Overall this project was highly beneficial to me as an aspiring User Experience/User Interface
                      designer and will be leaning heavily into all the lessons I learned as I move forward and on to
                      new projects. The big takeaway for me was how important Human Centered Design is in the software
                      or product development cycle - if we can get this part right from the start, the rest of the
                      development will make sense and have a higher chance of success when released to the end users.<br /></p>
