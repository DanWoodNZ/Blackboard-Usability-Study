            <h2 class="display-4">Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>The usability testing can be described as the most fundamental usability method.
              There are four main types of usability testing: <br /><br />

              Exploratory, to test preliminary concepts and evaluate their promise.<br /><br />

              Assessment, to test features during implementation.<br /><br />

              Comparison, to assess on design against another.<br /><br />

              Validation, to certify that features meet certain standards and benchmarks late in the development
              process.<br /><br />

              Every usability test has the primary goal of improving the usability
              of the end product and satisfying the needs of a particular group of
              users or the implementation of the product in a particular environment</p>

                abandoned the task. Each task had a different desired outcome. Task one was when the

                and task three was when the user read the exam time information aloud.

                  Task one was to open a lecture slide within the COMP719 – Applied Human Computer Interaction
                  paper. All users were successfully able to complete this task as most of them had experience
                  with the blackboard system, however some confusion was present due to the pages being named

                  Task two was to identify the total grade for ENSE701 Contemporary Methods in Software Engineering
                  Assignment One. If the grade was wrong we told the participant it was wrong and asked them to
                  continue
                  looking. All users were successfully able to complete this task, however several users were uncertain
                  whether they had found the correct grade, as the overall grade was not clearly labelled and there
                  were
                  multiple navigation pathways to the grade which added to the confusion.<br /><br />

                  Task three was to identify the date and time that the exam for COMP700 Text and Vision Intelligence
                  will take place. Most users noted that the placement of the timetable was unusual and not intuitive,
                  and that without previous experience this would be a difficult task to complete. This was proved when
                  participant 5 did not have any previous experience with the exam timetable and was unable to complete
                  the task. Since participant 5 could not complete the task they were allotted the max time as a
                  default.
                  His result was omitted from the average completion time for consistency but was left in the total
                  time.<br /><br />

                  <b>Year:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Three<br /><br />

                  <br />My name is Saksham Anand, and I am in final semester of Bachelor of Computer & Information
                  Sciences,
                  majoring in Computational Intelligence. Our study was essentially based around the usability of AUT’s
                  blackboard system, with different user demographics. The participants were bought into the lab and
                  given
                  a set of instructions to complete a task, this was combined with pre and post task questionnaire and
                  allowed
                  us to judge the users thought of chain. My role in this project was to work with the team in
                  preparing the
                  pre and post task questionnaires that the user will be using, and writing the research section of the
                  report.

                  <br />I discovered some interesting points about the human psychology during the user interviews of
                  the blackboard.
                  In specific, I found that people often like to categorize things in different ways, for example
                  during our
                  experiment some people expected grades to be under the ‘paper page’ on blackboard, however after not
                  finding
                  the grades under paper page, the user then decided to go look for a page which contains all the
                  grades. This
                  was interesting for me because the grades page is technically categorized as well, so I expected
                  users to
                  straight look there. One question this has me wondering is why do categorisations differ between
                  users, for
                  example some people sort out blocks by their shapes, however others may sort out blocks by their
                  colour.

                  <br /><br />I also found the following points interesting about this study:<br /><br />
                  This study gave me insights into User-Centered Design (UCD), as part of the research I discovered the
                  UCD
                  methodology where users are interviewed during the development stages of a software or a website, and
                  based
                  off the interviews the pain points are fixed during development stage. If this methodology is applied
                  to
                  blackboard upgrade development, it would allow the system to be user friendly where it is built on
                  user feedback.<br />

                  I learnt how people from different backgrounds and diversity have different experience with
                  blackboard, for
                  example some of the mature/older students took a bit longer to navigate blackboard, compared to those
                  who might
                  have used similar knowledge management system in high school (such as Knowledgenet).<br />

                  Most importantly, I discovered that building softwares and applications is not only about code and
                  project
                  management, its more about the users who will be using the product. There is no point in me spending
                  months
                  coding a software, if the end users don’t understand and like the final outcome.

                  <br /><br />To sum it up, I believe the project accomplished its goal of obtaining insights into area
                  of problems within
                  AUT’s blackboard website. We discovered several points of interest where blackboard could be
                  improved, such as
                  having lecture powerpoints open within browser instead of forcing users to download them. With proper
                  planning
                  for pre and post activity questionnaire we were able to capture and analyze user data from the tasks,
                  which
                  allowed us to check if any correlation existed between users finding website easy to navigate and how
                  fast
                  they completed the task.
